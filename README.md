# COSC 480 DS Project

The project guidelines can be found on the [course website](https://github.com/colgate-cosc480ds/lecture).

Please describe any VM setup required for your project here.

This could include commands to download data from online sources.  (Ideally, you should *not* commit raw data to your repo but instead provide instructions on how to obtain it.)
